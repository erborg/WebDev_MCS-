					<p">Dero and Crap met Robert Flux at an indie festival in Wolfsburg in 1989. They found out that they liked the same kind of music and wanted to start a band, which would combine the rock and electro scene; thus, Oomph! was born.</p>
					<p> On their first tour they were just those three, and played the music playback, except Dero, who sang. Tobias "Tobi" Gloge, their first live bassist, was exchanged for Hagen Godicke in 2004. When asked how Oomph! came up with their name, Dero said that the name was chosen because of its peculiarity.</p>
